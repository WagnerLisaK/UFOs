# UFOs

# Overview of Project
This project was to provide users with a web resource in order to browse UFO data.

# Results
The website is very easy to use and has great "curb appeal".  To use the website, follow the instructions below.

1. The empty filter appears below. Type a value in any of the fields following the example data in each cell.

2. After you enter your filter in any of the cells and then leave the cell with a mouse-click or key entry, the table will filter.  As an example, I filtered for the date of 1/4/2010 and got the following results:

3. Then, I added the state of California (ca) and pressed "ENTER" and the following results appeared:

4. Next, I added the shape of "unknown", pressed "ENTER" and the following results appeared:

5. Reload the page to reset the filter.

6. As another example, I just wanted to know all of the UFO reports in the state of FL (Florida) and got the following results:

# Summary
One drawback of this design is that the "filter" button is no longer used and when you leave the input field, the table filters automatically.  This has its pros/cons but might make it difficult for the user to understand why the table is changing after every input.

My recommendation would be to put the "filter" button back, only filter on all the data when "ENTER"  <OR>  the "filter" button is pressed, and add a "Clear Filter" button.
